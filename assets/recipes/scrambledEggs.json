        "Crack the eggs into a bowl and whisk until the yolks and whites are fully combined.",

        "Pour the eggs into the pan and let them cook for about 30 seconds without stirring.",
        "Using a spatula, gently push the eggs from the edges of the pan towards the center, allowing the uncooked eggs to flow to the edges.",
        "Repeat the previous step until the eggs are mostly set but still slightly runny.",
        "Add the salt, pepper, and milk (if using) to the eggs and stir until fully combined.",
        "Continue cooking the eggs, stirring occasionally, until they reach your desired level of doneness.",
        "Serve immediately."
